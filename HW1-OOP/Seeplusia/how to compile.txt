Open this folder in vscode by choosing File->Open Folder

The game can be run by simply pressing F5 from vscode. If due to some reason it doesn't work, then go compiling and running it from terminal, as explained below.

Dummy Changes to Commit

Run this command in the terminal

g++ *.cpp -IC:\mingw_dev_lib\include\SDL2 -LC:\mingw_dev_lib\lib -w -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2_ttf

If there is no error, your program is compiled successfully, and a.exe is generated as output. Now run the program by this command:

a.exe

There will be error to execute it, as some files are missing. You have to copy all the files from c:\mingw_dev_lib\bin and paste them to your current folder.

Now execute the a.exe again.


If you are executing from command prompt rather than VSCode's terminal, then you have to execute this command:

g++ *.cpp -IC:\mingw_dev_lib\include\SDL2 -LC:\mingw_dev_lib\lib -w -Wl,-subsystem,windows -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image
